                         This was my first exposure to faunal analysis as well as archaeological lab work in general. I started this project in the fall of my junior year of college, and it continued into the spring semester of that same year. This faunal assemblage consisted mostly of small mammal bones, but it had a fair amount of meat cuts of larger mammals as well. This allowed me to talk a little about meat consumption patterns and foodways from this particular site in Boise. I've been hooked on historical zooarchaeology since this project.
